## LinkedIn Experience Scraper 
_started in August 2021_ 

The goal is to produce a script that can calculate years of experience of a LinkedIn profile given the profile url. 

There are two files:
- `extract_experience_from_url.py` is the modularized version of the script.
- `years_from_url.py` is the rough version for testing purposes.

To use, simply replace the following in the script:
- Chrome driver path
- login email address 
- login password 

The text file contains the index of all the job titles that are relevant to Grit. The script currently assumes that this file is in the same directory as the script.
